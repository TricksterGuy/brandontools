Its better if you clone my repo instead of downloading the source in case something is found broken and I fix it.

Optional if you want the gimp mode 4 functionality
Description:
This isn't really necessary unless you don't trust me and don't know how to use gimp.
There are two algorithms I use for mode 4, my own algorithm or send your image to gimp first. 
Installing this will allow brandontools to automagically run gimp for you and convert the image to indexed color.
However you can achieve the same effect by converting your images to indexed color beforehand.
1) sudo apt-get install gimp (To get GIMP) (You need to do this if you are running Ubuntu)
2) Run GIMP at least once to generate directories
3) Copy the file makeindexed.scm to ~/.gimp-2.6/scripts
4) You can use this command to do 3) cp makeindexed.scm ~/.gimp-2.6/scripts

To install brandontools
-----------------------
0) If you want the mode 4 gimp functionality (used with the Mode 4 homework) then do the above first.
1) Install dependancies.  You should already have wxwidgets 2.9 by the complx install instructions.
   However this time you need ImageMagick or magick++ specifically. so get that terminal ready
   sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev
2) Time to build the program in a terminal in the root of the source tree, this the same directory where this file you are reading is located, execute the following.
    make && sudo make install
    if there are any errors please report them to me directly.
3) Type brandontools in a terminal if it says 0.9.5.0 plus an error message about not specifying array name + input files then you are set up.
4) Read the included readme file on how to use the program.
