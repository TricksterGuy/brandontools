Optional if you want the gimp mode 4 functionality if you want this then do this first!

To install brandontools
-----------------------
0) If you want the mode 4 gimp functionality (used with the Mode 4 homework) then do the above first.
1) Like any other .deb file sudo dpkg -i <deb file>
2) If it fails you are missing dependencies.  You may do sudo apt-get install -f to get them in this case
  Here is the exact list of dependancies
    libmagick++5 (or libmagick++X where X is the version number so if 5 fails try 6)
    libmagickcore5
    libmagickwand5
3) Type brandontools in a terminal if it says 0.9.3.0 then you are set up.
4) Read the included readme file on how to use the program (make sure your command is correct, because I do little error checking!)
