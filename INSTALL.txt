Its better if you clone my repo instead of downloading the source in case something is found broken and I fix it.

To install brandontools
-----------------------
1) Install dependancies.  You should already have wxwidgets 3.0 by the complx install instructions. If not then go back and install wxwidgets 3.   
   (or use the included install script)
   However this time you need ImageMagick or magick++ specifically. so get that terminal ready
   sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev libwxgtk-media3.0-dev
   the same directory where this file you are reading is located, execute the following.
    make && sudo make install
    if there are any errors please report them to me directly.
3) Type brandontools in a terminal if it says 1.0.0.0 or whatever the version number is now plus an error message about not specifying array name + input files then you are set up.
4) Read the included readme file on how to use the program.
